# Welcome to [byBruno.io](http://bybruno.io/)

This repository contains the source code for my website, where you can find projects I have worked on, my experience.

This site is using:
- React with ViteJS
- Styles and animations with TailwindCss
- Notion as a CMS to manage content
- An API using Fastify and serve content
- And of course, docker
